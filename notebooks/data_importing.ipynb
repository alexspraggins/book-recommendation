As such, he gathered hard, corroborated intelligence on Argentine intentions over the Falklands - which the British establishment then chose to ignore. The reasons behind this British decision, and its disastrous and inevitable consequences in the South Atlantic, are the main story of this book. There were three main players in the war, each of them trying to overcome their own cultural baggage. The Argentines were riddled with guilt: after years of fighting a morally repugnant campaign against its own people, the Argentine military saw a war for the Malvinas islands as a perfect opportunity to win back their self-respect. The hands of the Americans were also bloody from the likewise dirty wars they had sponsored and abetted in Central America. For Britain it was simply the last straw after decades of humiliation.\",\n          \"Detective Sergeant Lloyd Hopkins of the LAPD, fueled by a desire to protect innocence, confronts a murderer who is driven by the same forces when he investigates a series of murders of young women in the Los Angeles area.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":87}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["books_cleaned = books_missing_25_words.drop([\"subtitle\", \"missing_description\", \"age_of_book\", \"words_in_description\"], axis=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"cRYA6koFC4QN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758916071277,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Spraggins","userId":"06210800496456461208"}}},"execution_count":88,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["books_cleaned"],"metadata":{"id":"sprwRUJgDDv4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758916071279,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Alexander Spraggins","userId":"06210800496456461208"}},"outputId":"c81046be-09fa-41ff-e93f-dafc5cc3c3e8"},"execution_count":89,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["             isbn13      isbn10  \\\n","0     9780002005883  0002005883   \n","1     9780002261982  0002261987   \n","3     9780006178736  0006178731   \n","4     9780006280897  0006280897   \n","5     9780006280934  0006280935   \n","...             ...         ...   \n","6802  9788172235222  8172235224   \n","6803  9788173031014  8173031010   \n","6804  9788179921623  817992162X   \n","6805  9788185300535  8185300534   \n","6808  9789027712059  9027712050   \n","\n","                                                  title  \\\n","0                                                Gilead   \n","1                                          Spider's Web   \n","3                                        Rage of angels   \n","4                                        The Four Loves   \n","5                                   The Problem of Pain   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","6802                                  Mistaken Identity   \n","6803                                Journey to the East   \n","6804  The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: A Fable About F...   \n","6805                                          I Am that   \n","6808                           The Berlin Phenomenology   \n","\n","                                           authors  \\\n","0                               Marilynne Robinson   \n","1                  Charles Osborne;Agatha Christie   \n","3                                   Sidney Sheldon   \n","4                              Clive Staples Lewis   \n","5                              Clive Staples Lewis   \n","...                                            ...   \n","6802                              Nayantara Sahgal   \n","6803                                 Hermann Hesse   \n","6804                                  Robin Sharma   \n","6805  Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj;Sudhakar S.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.
